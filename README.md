Project Title: Development of a GPT-Based Model for Solving Mathematics Problems

Objective: 

The objective of this project is to develop a GPT-based model that can accurately predict solutions for a wide range of mathematics problems from elementary arithmetic to advanced calculus, to support students, educators, and educational technology developers.

Introduction:

With the increasing reliance on digital tools for education, there is a growing need for intelligent systems that can assist in learning complex subjects like mathematics. This project aims to harness the power of GPT’s natural language processing capabilities to create a model that not only predicts answers to math problems but also provides step-by-step solutions to enhance understanding and learning outcomes.

Datasets:

PRM800K: A large-scale dataset of math problems designed to train and evaluate mathematical problem-solving models.

AQuA: A dataset from Google DeepMind that includes annotated quantitative reasoning problems.

Math_Dataset: A comprehensive collection of math problems and solutions available on Hugging Face.

MMLU-STEM: A STEM-focused dataset by TIGER-Lab.

KPIs(Key Performance Indicators):

Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correctly solved math problems out of the total problems tested.
Inference Time: Track the average time taken by the model to generate solutions for given problems.
Generalization: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate set of unseen problems to assess its ability to generalize.

Consistency: Analyze the model’s performance across different categories of math problems to ensure it is uniformly effective.

Stakeholders:

Students and Educators: Enhanced learning tools and resources for understanding complex math problems.
Educational and Research Institutions: Improved methodologies and tools for teaching and research.
Developers and Data Scientists: Access to a new tool for integrating into educational applications and further development.

Conclusion: 

This project aims to create a powerful tool that leverages GPT-based models to solve a wide range of math problems, providing valuable resources to students, educators, and developers. By using diverse and comprehensive datasets, and focusing on key performance indicators such as accuracy, inference time, generalization, and consistency, we aim to deliver a model that not only meets current educational needs but also sets the stage for future advancements in educational technology.
